# English-French Translator utilizing the IBM Watson Translator Service

A Python web application creation and deployment exercise.

In this exercise, I used IBM Watson APIs to create functions for an English-French translator. Included is a translation function and a test function that ensure that the translation code is correct and will run. I also utilized Pylint to ensure that my coding standards are compliant.
